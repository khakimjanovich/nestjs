# First steps of learning nestjs
Nest uses expressjs under the hood, but it can be changed to fastify. It was built 
using JavaScript with full support of TypeScript. Combines elements of OOP, FF and
FRP.

## What is TS
    TypeScipt = JavaScript + A type system

### Type system

* Help us catch errors during development.
* Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
* Only active during development
* Doesn't provide any performance optimization
